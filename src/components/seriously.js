        <p>  Travelling through a landscape of consecutive projects kids can learn about different types of renewable energies, build their own energy circuit,  to light up their custom designed lamp and make a renewable energy station to power the lamp. 
Super Makers is designed to be accessible for anyone who wants to take part, the only thing participants need is an internet connection and a few simple materials like paper and cardboard. We are using VR and computer vision as a tool to get kids engaged with both the  to tangible, and imaginative aspects of making. For instance, kids are able to check the efficiency of a wind turbine with an RPM counter by holding their creations up to the camera.

Super Makers is social and creates opportunities for kids to celebrate their creation and be part of a global effort to change our world.
