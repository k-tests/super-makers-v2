### Super Makers is a series of workshops and games for building sustainable worlds. The first episode is dedicated to renewable energies: Wind, Sun and Water.
### Travelling through a landscape of consecutive projects kids learn about different types of renewable energies, make their own energy circuit, design a custom lamp and build a renewable energy station to power it.
